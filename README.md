# CDTilburg_website
Website for CoderDojo's Tilburg

Made by Lisa E. Rombout

Simpel website that links to all the separate dojo's and to Code Brabant. Some interactivity where colored circles follow your mouse.
Website here (Dutch): http://coderdojo-tilburg.nl/

You'll need the p5.min.js file for the interactive part to work:
